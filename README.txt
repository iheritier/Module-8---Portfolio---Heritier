Project Three (Module Seven) Summary

This project was all about creating an interface between the user and files while connecting
two separate programming languages, C++ and Python, within Visual Studio. The code used C++ for
user I/O and Python to perform the actual file operations.

I'm particularly pleased with the use of pseudocode (comments and documentation) throughout the
program. I think this project could have a lot of future utility for myself and other programmers
as a result. The project performs everything reasonably efficiently and the output is clear and
concise. This also speaks to making the code more maintainable, readable, and adaptable.

If I knew more about code security, I think I could use C++ or another language to properly
privatize the details of what's going on behind the scenes here. I also think it would be good
to create code that is a little more responsive to different formats of files. One easy and 
quick modification here would be to have the user input the file name rather than have it hard-
coded into the program. But even then, you'd need to have a specific format for your text file;
what if a program could parse any text file for what it needs?

It was particularly challenging here to set up the project in the first place, with the interface
between C++ and Python within Visual Studio. I had a previous project to draw from, and plenty of
video tutorials, but the attention to detail required in getting everything perfect is a difficult
prerequisite sometimes, and that proved to be the case here. Once I got started, the code came
relatively easily.

The transferrable skills I picked up from this project definitely include my improved understanding
of the sheer power of Visual Studio. I hadn't tried combining multiple languages before, but now
that I've done it with the basics, I think completing more complicated tasks with that skill is
well in reach.
